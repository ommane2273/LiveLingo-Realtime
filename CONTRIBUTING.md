# Contributing to LiveLingo RealTime

Thanks for your interest! A few simple rules to keep the repo healthy:

1. Fork the repo and create a topic branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Keep PRs small and focused. Include screenshots or a short demo where relevant.
3. Follow the commit message suggestions in the README.
4. Run `npm install` before making changes to ensure dependencies are consistent.

### Pull request template checklist
- [ ] Did you explain the change clearly?
- [ ] Does the code run locally?
- [ ] Are there no console errors in the browser?
- [ ] Is the README updated when needed?

Maintainers: review PRs within 3 business days when possible.
